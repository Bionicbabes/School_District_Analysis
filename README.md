# School_District_Analysis
------------------------------
# Overview 

The school board has notified me that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to me for help. The school board has asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once youâ€™ve replaced the math and reading scores, the school board would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

- How was the distict summary affected ?
We found that there were a total of 461 students from Thomas High School.  All of their scores have been removed from the over totals student going from 39,170 students to 38,709 students.  Data frames show an ~ 25 to 30 % increase in the passing scores from the Thomas High School.
